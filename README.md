Laravel Problem
Dear engineer,

Please enhance this webapp with the following requirements:

Only logged in users can view /home
Add yourself as new users
Fix all errors (yes, it was there on purpose)
Handle route name "error" by returning error message (without error page)
get data from API url "api.biznetnetworks.com/favoritefruits" with HTTP request method GET and return the data with processing response time
Modify code TestController.php using "Favorite" model to return data from Favorite model sorted by smallest number of favorite fruits per person
Create something cool ! (optional)
There are no specific rules on how you should enhance this webapp, use your creativity. Feel free to add new features or delete anything unnecessary. You can create/delete/rename files/documents as you wish, create new table, change table structure, etc.

notes: Current user : admin@admin.com , password : admin Create your own user with password : user

After you are satisfied with it, zip and send via email to career_it@biznetnetworks.com (please exclude /vendor directory), and include "[Laravel Challenge]" on email subject.
